Student Elance web app (JSP | Servlets| MYSQL | IBM Bluemix (Cloud)  | JQuery)

This is more than a freelancing web app – students built a personality profile matching module using Keirsey Temperament Sorter (KTS) technique to suggest a job to job seeker. Keirsey Temperament theory suggests that there are four temperament groups that describe a person’s behavior. These four temperaments are Artisans, Guardians, Rationales and Idealists. We believed that any student may not just be good at performing a coding job but may gain interesting life experience in doing a writing or translation job if that is also a hidden talent they have.

The project is selected by our Professor to be published in IBM developer portal.
